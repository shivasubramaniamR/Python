#Variables
#    Rules for Python variables:
#     1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#     2. A variable name cannot start with a number
#     3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#     4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


# My first Addtion using Variables
first_number = 5
_second_Number = 10
print(first_number+_second_Number)

# Static, Dynamic, Strong, Weak 

    # Static - Statically-typed programming languages do type checking (i.e., the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types on values) at compile-time

    # Dynamic - Statically-typed programming languages do type checking (i.e., the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types on values) at Run time

    # Weak - Weakly-typed languages make conversions between unrelated types implicitly

    # Strong - strongly-typed languages donâ€™t allow implicit conversions between unrelated types.
